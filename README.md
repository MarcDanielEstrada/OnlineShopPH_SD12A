# OnlineShopPH_SD12A
Mobile Computing - Final Project Template (May 2018)

Hi Students from SD12A,

There are couple of changes from our previous plans. As was discussed on May 3, 2018 regarding your “super easy” PBL, kindly follow these steps:
1.	Create an account in ~~bitbucket~~ [Github](https://github.com) instead.
2.	Once all your accounts are created, ~~let me know ASAP by replying to this email~~ go directly to this [link](https://github.com/delose/OnlineShopPH_SD12A) and clone the project via [Gitbash](https://git-scm.com/download/win) or Android studio.
~~a.	I will provide you access to the project that each team will be using.~~
b.	I might also provide a guide to use ~~bitbucket~~ github and basic git commands (in Android Studio). But to give you a head start, you may watch this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_d4fFFAJKVA).
3.	From the master branch, each one should create his/her own branch based on your PBL project in Android Studio. You may also use a command line tool such as [Gitbash](https://git-scm.com/download/win) and use command: git checkout -b <branch name> (e.g. for Remer, your branch name can be “paws-it-beta” or “paws-it-staging”).
4.	Once the branch is created, you may commit/push your code changes there.
5.	As leads of your respective teams, I presume everyone in this email will take responsibility of their branch which means, you won’t let other teams overwrite your code. 
6.	The PBL I would require you is a basic app with navigation. Your app must contain at least two fragments / activities:
a.	About / Description
i.	Give a brief info about your app and what it can do
b.	Subscribe  (requires [Firebase Database](https://firebase.google.com/docs/database/admin/retrieve-data))
i.	This lets the app save emails (for reference) from users to supposedly inform them once the app is released and ready to use
ii.	To do this, you must provide an EditText field where a user must input their email and click a button to save it in a database remotely.
7.	For apps with photo display functionality, additional credit will be given (e.g. recycler view + firebase). You may add firebase storage, so you can upload pics and display them in your app.  Be as creative as possible.
8.	I expect submission of six (6) branches by Wednesday, May 9, 2018. Be able to run/demo your app on the same day.
9.	In NEO, I will upload all presented lecture slides from yesterday and from the past so you can refer to them.
10.	Lastly, kindly spread to your teammates.

If you have any additional questions or concerns, feel free to let me know anytime.

Good luck and… ![alt text](https://cdn.securem2.com/commonimages/event/168869/2018/4/download-3--display2.jpg "May the fourth be with you!")
