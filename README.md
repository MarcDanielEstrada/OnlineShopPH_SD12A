# OnlineShopPH_SD12A
Mobile Computing - Final Project Template (May 2018)

Hi Students from SD12A,

There are couple of changes from our previous plans. As was discussed on May 3, 2018 regarding your “super easy” PBL, kindly follow these steps:
1.	Create an account in ~~bitbucket~~ [Github](https://github.com) instead.
2.	Once all your accounts are created, ~~let me know ASAP by replying to this email~~ go directly to this [link](https://github.com/delose/OnlineShopPH_SD12A) and clone the project via [Gitbash](https://git-scm.com/download/win) or Android studio. See further instructions below.
~~a.	I will provide you access to the project that each team will be using.~~
b.	I might also provide a guide to use ~~bitbucket~~ github and basic git commands (in Android Studio). But to give you a head start, you may watch this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_d4fFFAJKVA).
3.	From the master branch, each one should create his/her own branch based on your PBL project in Android Studio. You may also use a command line tool such as [Gitbash](https://git-scm.com/download/win) and use command: git checkout -b <branch name> (e.g. for Remer, your branch name can be “paws-it-beta” or “paws-it-staging”).
4.	Once the branch is created, you may commit/push your code changes there.
5.	As leads of your respective teams, I presume everyone in this email will take responsibility of their branch which means, you won’t let other teams overwrite your code. 
6.	The PBL I would require you is a basic app with navigation. Your app must contain at least two fragments / activities:
a.	About / Description
i.	Give a brief info about your app and what it can do
b.	Subscribe  (requires [Firebase Database](https://firebase.google.com/docs/database/admin/retrieve-data))
i.	This lets the app save emails (for reference) from users to supposedly inform them once the app is released and ready to use
ii.	To do this, you must provide an EditText field where a user must input their email and click a button to save it in a database remotely.
7.	For apps with photo display functionality, additional credit will be given (e.g. recycler view + firebase). You may add firebase storage, so you can upload pics and display them in your app.  Be as creative as possible.
8.	I expect submission of six (6) branches by Wednesday, May 9, 2018. Be able to run/demo your app on the same day.
9.	In NEO, I will upload all presented lecture slides from yesterday and from the past so you can refer to them.
10.	Lastly, kindly spread to your teammates.

If you have any additional questions or concerns, feel free to let me know anytime.

Good luck and… ![alt text](https://cdn.securem2.com/commonimages/event/168869/2018/4/download-3--display2.jpg "May the fourth be with you!")

## Edit a file

You’ll start by editing this README file to learn how to edit a file in Bitbucket.

1. Click **Source** on the left side.
2. Click the README.md link from the list of files.
3. Click the **Edit** button.
4. Delete the following text: *Delete this line to make a change to the README from Bitbucket.*
5. After making your change, click **Commit** and then **Commit** again in the dialog. The commit page will open and you’ll see the change you just made.
6. Go back to the **Source** page.

---

## Create a file

Next, you’ll add a new file to this repository.

1. Click the **New file** button at the top of the **Source** page.
2. Give the file a filename of **contributors.txt**.
3. Enter your name in the empty file space.
4. Click **Commit** and then **Commit** again in the dialog.
5. Go back to the **Source** page.

Before you move on, go ahead and explore the repository. You've already seen the **Source** page, but check out the **Commits**, **Branches**, and **Settings** pages.

## Clone a repository

Use these steps to clone from SourceTree, our client for using the repository command-line free. Cloning allows you to work on your files locally. If you don't yet have SourceTree, [download and install first](https://www.sourcetreeapp.com/). If you prefer to clone from the command line, see [Clone a repository](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/4whODQ).

1. You’ll see the clone button under the **Source** heading. Click that button.
2. Now click **Check out in SourceTree**. You may need to create a SourceTree account or log in.
3. When you see the **Clone New** dialog in SourceTree, update the destination path and name if you’d like to and then click **Clone**.
4. Open the directory you just created to see your repository’s files.

Now that you're more familiar with your Bitbucket repository, go ahead and add a new file locally. You can [push your change back to Bitbucket with SourceTree](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/iqyBMg), or you can [add, commit,](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/8QhODQ) and [push from the command line](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/NQ0zDQ).
